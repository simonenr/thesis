                    For time is the longest distance between two places reflects upon cultural anxieties about digitally-mediated relationships. The series of silk textiles depicts sites of vulnerability translated into ASCII code, operating within the tension between the digital and the physical. Intervening messages in the lines of characters only become apparent from certain vantage point, posing questions about how we construct intimacy and determine authenticity in a world that is increasingly saturated by technology.

                   Our lives are increasingly conducted digitally. Our relationships are firmly entrenched in the digital sphere. The ways in which we construct intimacy—at one time set securely in the physical realm—are undergoing constant reformulations, becoming progressively more complex as our lives become more saturated with the digital. From the mundane to the emotionally-loaded, the bulk of our interactions are augmented by technology: scheduling appointments, accepting a job position, meeting new partners—and, even, ending relationships with partners. As Donna Haraway reflects upon in <em>We are all cyborgs</em>, the digital and the physical are so intimately intertwined that it is no longer possible to separate the two. To be a cyborg is not to have wires running beside ones veins, but to simply interact with the digital to the extent that we do daily.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>1</sup></a>  If we are all cyborgs, that means we are constructed, not natural; we are free to do away with presupposed “biologically-determined” gender roles and construct ourselves anew.

                        We are undergoing a democratization of intimacy. The internet’s communication channels enable us to transgress the isolation imposed on us by institutions.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>2</sup></a> While previously our social distance was limited to the people in our immediate proximity, new communications technologies have enabled us to reach individual nearly anywhere in the world, at any given time.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>3</sup></a> We can now choose to prioritize emotional closeness before physical closeness, regardless of our own location. In our coexistence with cyborgs and embodiments of such, the line between the public and the private becomes increasingly grey. The ‘continuous conversation’ that is necessary to foster a relationship carries on, enabled by our constant convenient proximity to technology.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>4</sup></a>

                        However many positive benefits may arise from advancements in telecommunications—a broadened social distance, the democratization of intimacy, the emancipation from insincere oppressive structures—authenticity comes into question. The less expressive a medium is, the less assured the parties are of mutual attentiveness.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>5</sup></a> Space and time are delocalized.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>6</sup></a> We don’t know whether the other party is engaged, technically available, or where they are located, leading to the eternal ‘where are you?’ in the opening of conversations.
                    </article>

                    <article>
                        One party is passive, the other is active; one is the subject, one is the object. The immediacy necessary for much of our interactions is overlooked.<a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>7</sup></a> Though the sensation of communicating through wires and screens may at times be novel, the physicality is lost. Luce Irigaray meditates upon this at length: <em>we have made each other into images and sounds outside of our own sight and hearing. We have conjured up representations or doubles of ourselves more perfect than we are when present to each other. We have imagined reproductions of men and women which have exiled us from ourselves.</em><a href="#endnotes" class="footnote scroll"><sup>8</sup></a> In the digital sphere, we construct our own selves, we construct our partners, and we construct our own realities– separate from the realities of those close to us. Armed with new technologies, we begin to wonder: is tactility integral to our relationships? How critical is our relationship with time to our relationship with each other? Is authenticity held between our eyes and our two hands, or can we place our faith in the letters on the screen? As artificial intelligence becomes more plausible, can one still clearly define physicality, authenticity, and intimacy? How may these technologies serve to one day replace <em>(supplement?)</em> human intimacy?

                    <article>
                        To be able to converse in real-time with a partner who is 6500 kilometres away is a newfound joy, but physicality is yet to be fully resolved. A text message can’t replace a hand on the small of your back, guiding you through a crowd. At the heart of <em>For time is the longest distance between two places</em> is a conditional faith in the benefits of technology and a hyperawareness about the ways in which technology shapes how we construct intimacy. Under the pretence of “innovation,” our lives continue to be saturated with digital technologies, advancements with which we can barely keep up. We are suspended in the liminal space, propped up by digital tools which we can’t quite make sense of just yet. In this perpetual state of transition, we are constantly attempting to resolve the tension between the digital and the physical. We grasp at apparitions of each other. I see your face and hear a voice. And sometimes, our knees brush.
